# NBody-with-STREAMS
Just a simple NBody problem with multiple threads. Originally for school, messed around to play with functional style.

Doesn't do anything super special. Simulates gravity/ellastic collisions. Sterams/minimal side effects have the effect of needing minimal synchronization. Were I not counting the number of collisions, it'd be even easier.
